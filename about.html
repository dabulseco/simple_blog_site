    <section class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="section-title">Professional Background</h3>
        <p>
            Dylan Bulseco is a Senior Vice President and Principal Scientist at the Institute for Future
            Intelligence (IFI). He holds a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Biophysics from Oregon State University
            and brings over two decades of experience in fluorescence-based instrumentation, reagents,
            and analytical applications spanning research, diagnostics, medical devices, and therapeutics.
        </p>
        <p>
            His career bridges academic research and commercialization, with leadership roles as Principal
            Investigator, co-Principal Investigator, or senior personnel on federally funded projects
            supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF),
            and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

    <!-- AI in Education Focus -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="section-title">Focus on AI in Education</h3>
        <p>
            At IFI, Dylan’s work centers on studying the impact of artificial intelligence on education,
            particularly in STEM and life sciences contexts. His research examines how AI tools—such as
            intelligent tutors, generative models, and data-driven learning systems—transform pedagogy,
            assessment, and knowledge construction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than treating AI as a replacement for educators or expertise, his work emphasizes
            AI as a pedagogical partner: a tool that augments human reasoning, supports inquiry-based
            learning, and enables educators to design more adaptive, reflective, and equitable learning
            environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            This research draws on transcript analysis, learning sciences theory, and human–AI interaction
            studies to understand not only what students learn, but <em>how</em> learning unfolds through
            dialogue, reflection, and guided exploration in AI-enhanced educational ecosystems.

    <!-- Cultural and Workforce Engagement -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="section-title">Cultural Relevance and Workforce Development</h3>
        <p>
            As a Native Hawaiian, Dylan is deeply committed to culturally responsive science education
            and workforce development. His projects integrate computational science, data science,
            and artificial intelligence into life sciences education in ways that respect local
            knowledge systems and community contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
            He has been actively involved in initiatives supporting science education and workforce
            pathways in both Massachusetts and Hawaiʻi, with a particular focus on community colleges,
            place-based learning, and experiential research programs that prepare students for emerging
            STEM careers.
